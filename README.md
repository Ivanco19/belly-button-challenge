# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, an interactive dashboard is built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

D3 library is used to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json, which is the source data. Plotly is the tool used to plot the different visualizations in this challenge and the code was developed using javascript.
